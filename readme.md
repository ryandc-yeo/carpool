# Carpool

CS 188 project

## Setup Instruction

Clone the repo with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ryandc-yeo/carpool.git
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
cd client && npm i && cd ../server && npm i && cd ..
```

## Running the application

You should create two terminals:

1. In the `/client` directory run `npx expo start`. You can choose to scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your phone, but I'd recommend using a simulator from XCode or Android Studio.
2. In the `/server` directory run `node server.ts`.
